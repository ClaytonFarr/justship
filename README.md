========================

# Just Ship

A batteries included Svelte 5 SaaS Boilerplate - https://github.com/ocluf/justship

## Pricing UX + Plan Assumptions

The current UX and code presume you have a free plan, plus optional paid plans. When a user signs up, the app will create a new user record + an associated Stripe customer record + that is subscribed automatically to your free plan. The user can then change plans within their app settings when prompted/desired.

## Getting Started üöÄ

### Local Development

1. Use original repo as template (or fork) to create new GitHub repo
2. Within local copy of repo run `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` or `pnpm install`
3. Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`
   - add a value to `.env` for `FROM_EMAIL` (e.g. 'noreply@domain.com')
4. Run `npm run generate && npm run migrate` to create a local database
5. [Install mailpit](https://mailpit.axllent.org/docs/install/) to receive emails locally
   - start mailpit running in background (e.g. `brew services start mailpit`)
   - note: can stop background mailpit process after dev (e.g. `brew services stop mailpit`)
6. run `npm run dev`
7. create a new account at [sign in page](http://localhost:5173/signin) using any email address
   - check for sign-up email at [Mailpit localhost:8025](http://localhost:8025/)
   - click email activation link to create account and sign in
8. Update missing / placeholder content
   - update static resources (or alternatively, the links to them across templates):
     - `static/logo.svg`
     - `static/favicons/‚Ä¶` (e.g. https://favicon.io/)
     - `static/socialcard.jpg`
     - `static/product-image-hero.png` / `static/product-screenshot-hero.svg`
     - `static/signin-image.jpg`
   - update marketing content:
     - can update marketing content in `src/lib/data/marketingContent.ts`
       - sections without content will not be shown
     - can reorder marketing sections by editing `src/routes/(marketing)/+page.svelte`
     - can update privacy policy and terms in `src/routes/(marketing)/privacy/+page.svelte` and `src/routes/(marketing)/terms/+page.svelte`
       - e.g. Privacy/Terms [References](https://github.com/basecamp/policies/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#steal-these-policies) of [Generators](https://app.termsfeed.com/)
9. Setup plans and billing with **[Stripe](https://stripe.com)**
   - create new account OR access existing account
     - configure public details at 'Settings : Business : Public details' (e.g. business name, help link, privacy/terms links, etc.)
   - setup test environment
     - search for 'Product Catalog'
       - create a product for each plan level (e.g. 'Starter Plan', 'Pro Plan', 'Elite Plan')
       - add pricing for each product
         - create at least one free plan (e.g. 'Starter Plan' / $0)
         - can optionally add multiple prices per product for monthly/yearly
         - will most likely use 'flat-rate' billing (for app recurring subscriptions)
         - within your free product (aka plan), select '...' menu link next to your $0 price and 'Copy price ID'
           - copy price id value to `STRIPE_FREE_PLAN_PRICE_ID_TEST` in `.env` (locally and in Vercel project)
     - configure Customer Portal settings at 'Settings : Billing : Customer portal'
       - e.g. business info, ability to switch subscription plans, etc.
       - optional: configure branding settings at 'Settings : Business : Branding'
     - search for 'Developers : Webhooks' (may be called 'Event Destinations' later)
       - create new endpoint with url `https://{www.yourdomain.com}/stripe/webhook`
       - add events to listen for:
         - `checkout.session.completed`
         - `customer.subscription.deleted`
         - `customer.subscription.updated`
         - `invoice.paid`
         - `invoice.payment_failed`
       - save endpoint and copy 'Signing secret' value to `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET_TEST` in `.env` (locally and in Vercel project)
     - search for 'Developers : API Keys'
       - copy key to `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY_TEST` in `.env` (locally and in Vercel project)
   - test plan subscriptions
     - you should now be able to in dev 1) create a new account, 2) verify email (using Mailpit), 3) see new Stripe user created with subscription to free product in Stripe's test environment
10. (Optional: if want to use Google sign-up/in) Setup Google OAuth with **[Google Cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com/)**
    - set `PUBLIC_GOOGLE_OAUTH_ENABLED=true` in `.env` (both locally and in Vercel project)
    - create new account, or access existing account
    - create new project, or use existing project
    - navigate to 'APIs & Services' : 'Credentials'
    - select '+ Create Credentials' : 'OAuth client ID'
    - (full details pending‚Ä¶)

## Tool / Service Rationale

- _Why Turso?_

  - The simplicity of SQLite, and Turso extends that simplicity by allowing it not to run on the same server as your application. This offers the best of both worlds: an excellent local development story and worry-free scalability and backups in production.

- _Why Vercel?_

  - Offers remarkable developer experience with features like branch previews and automatic deployments based on GitHub pushes. While it can be costlier with high traffic volumes, this boilerplate is meant for quick product experiments. If a product gains traction, migrating to another service is straightforward.

- _Why Stripe?_

  - Stripe provides an excellent developer experience. While I'm not particularly concerned that they aren't the merchant of record‚Äîa key selling point for Paddle or LemonSqueezy ‚Äî I am open to other payment providers. Feel free to submit a pull request to add alternative payment options.

- _Why PostHog?_
  - PostHog offers a generous free tier, an extensive feature set, and comprehensive documentation. Although I haven‚Äôt tested many other analytics providers, my positive experience with PostHog has persuaded me to stick with it.
