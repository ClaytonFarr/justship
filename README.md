## Tool / Service Rationale

- _Why Turso?_

  - The simplicity of SQLite, and Turso extends that simplicity by allowing it not to run on the same server as your application. This offers the best of both worlds: an excellent local development story and worry-free scalability and backups in production.

- _Why Vercel?_

  - Offers remarkable developer experience with features like branch previews and automatic deployments based on GitHub pushes. While it can be costlier with high traffic volumes, this boilerplate is meant for quick product experiments. If a product gains traction, migrating to another service is straightforward.

- _Why Stripe?_

  - Stripe provides an excellent developer experience. While I'm not particularly concerned that they aren't the merchant of record‚Äîa key selling point for Paddle or LemonSqueezy ‚Äî I am open to other payment providers. Feel free to submit a pull request to add alternative payment options.

- _Why PostHog?_
  - PostHog offers a generous free tier, an extensive feature set, and comprehensive documentation. Although I haven‚Äôt tested many other analytics providers, my positive experience with PostHog has persuaded me to stick with it.
