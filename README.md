# Just Ship ‚ö°Ô∏è Customized

A customized version of Fulco's [JustShip](https://github.com/ocluf/justship) SvelteKit marketing + app boilerplate.

This boilerplate provides a full stack shell for a SaaS application driven by SvelteKit with Typescript/Node and SQLite, with separate marketing and application front-ends, user accounts, auth access and control, and paid plans billed with Stripe.

## Customizations

# Just Ship

A batteries included Svelte 5 SaaS Boilerplate - https://github.com/ocluf/justship

## Pricing UX + Plan Assumptions

The current UX and code presume you have a free plan, plus optional paid plans. When a user signs up, the app will create a new user record + an associated Stripe customer record + that is subscribed automatically to your free plan. The user can then change plans within their app settings when prompted/desired.

## Getting Started üöÄ

### Local Development

**Initial Setup**

- Use this repo as template (or fork) to create new GitHub repo
- Within local copy of repo run `pnpm install`
- Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`
  - update PUBLIC environment variables to match your product/project
- Run `pnpm run generate-db && pnpm run migrate-db` to create a local database
  - can run `pnpm db:studio` to view local database tables
- [Install mailpit](https://mailpit.axllent.org/docs/install/) to receive test emails locally
  - start mailpit running in background in separate terminal (e.g. `brew services start mailpit`)
  - note: can stop background mailpit process after dev (e.g. `brew services stop mailpit`)
  - will be able to view emails at [http://localhost:8025/](http://localhost:8025/)
- Run `pnpm dev` to start local dev server & check for successful build

**Billing (Stripe) - Test Environment**

- Create new [Stripe](https://stripe.com) account OR access existing account
  - configure public details at 'Settings : Business : Public details' (e.g. business name, help link, privacy/terms links, etc.)
- Setup test environment
  - search for 'Product Catalog'
    - create a product for each plan level (e.g. 'Starter Plan', 'Pro Plan', 'Elite Plan')
    - add pricing for each product
      - create at least one free plan (e.g. 'Starter Plan' / $0)
      - can optionally add multiple prices per product for monthly/yearly
      - will most likely use 'flat-rate' billing (for app recurring subscriptions)
      - within your free product (aka plan), select '...' menu link next to your $0 price and 'Copy **price** ID'
        - copy price id value to `STRIPE_FREE_PLAN_PRICE_ID_TEST` in `.env`
  - configure Customer Portal settings at 'Settings : Billing : Customer portal'
    - e.g. business info, ability to switch subscription plans, etc.
    - optional: configure branding settings at 'Settings : Business : Branding'
  - search for 'Developers : Webhooks' (may be called 'Event Destinations' later)
    - create new endpoint with url `https://{www.yourdomain.com}/stripe/webhook`
    - add events to listen for:
      - `checkout.session.completed`
      - `customer.subscription.deleted`
      - `customer.subscription.updated`
      - `invoice.paid`
      - `invoice.payment_failed`
    - save endpoint

  - search for 'Developers : API Keys'
    - copy key to `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY_TEST` in `.env`
- test plan subscriptions; while running app in dev, you should now be able to:
  1. create a new account at [sign in page](http://localhost:5173/signin?new)
     - can use any email address
     - check for sign-up email at [Mailpit localhost:8025](http://localhost:8025/)
     - click email activation link to create account and sign in
  2. verify email (using Mailpit)
  3. see new Stripe user created with subscription to free product in Stripe's test environment

**Optional: Google OAuth**

- Setup Google OAuth with **[Google Cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com/)**
  - set `PUBLIC_GOOGLE_OAUTH_ENABLED=true` in `.env`
  - create new account, or access existing account

**Shadcn Components**

- Using [[Svelte Shadcn](https://next.shadcn-svelte.com/)] (version 5)
- Can install components with the add feature of the [CLI](https://next.shadcn-svelte.com/docs/cli) or copy code from website

## Tool / Service Rationale

- _Why Turso?_

  - The simplicity of SQLite, and Turso extends that simplicity by allowing it not to run on the same server as your application. This offers the best of both worlds: an excellent local development story and worry-free scalability and backups in production.

- _Why Vercel?_

  - Offers remarkable developer experience with features like branch previews and automatic deployments based on GitHub pushes. While it can be costlier with high traffic volumes, this boilerplate is meant for quick product experiments. If a product gains traction, migrating to another service is straightforward.

- _Why Stripe?_

  - Stripe provides an excellent developer experience. While I'm not particularly concerned that they aren't the merchant of record ‚Äî a key selling point for Paddle or LemonSqueezy ‚Äî it is possible to change to another payment provider.

- _Why PostHog?_
  - PostHog offers a generous free tier, an extensive feature set, and comprehensive documentation. Although I haven‚Äôt tested many other analytics providers, my positive experience with PostHog has persuaded me to stick with it.
